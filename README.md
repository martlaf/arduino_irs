# arduino_irs
This IRS is set to be used as an embedded system only collecting data, but not using them in real time.
The collected data can then be analysed (ex with MATLAB) in order to retreive the position and orientation of the embedded system.

Hardware required for this project is : Arduino (Due used), MPU (MPU6050 used), SD card.
